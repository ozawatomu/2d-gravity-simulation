<img src="Program_Demo.gif" width="600" alt="Program Demo">

This program simulates spherical objects in 2d space being pulled by each other according to [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation).

## Controls
To change the size of the object, use the mouse scroll wheel. You can see a hint of the size of the object before you create it.\
To create an object, click anywhere on the screen.\
To create an object with an initial velocity, click and drag on the screen (works like a slingshot).\
To show/hide the object's velocities, press the **V** key.\
To move an object already created, hover over it and then click and drag it.
